# Suggestion_bot
Bot for anonymous offers in a telegram channel

This is the simplest anonymous bot in Python. It has no unnecessary details, only basic functions: 
Sending text messages and pictures. It does not use databases, admin IDs or user information.
This bot can be useful for channel admins who don't want to bother and do something more complicated. In general, it's just a base on which you can additionally add the necessary functions, if necessary.

Since it was originally made for specific purposes, there are inserts in Russian, all of which can be replaced with the required text.
