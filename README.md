# Suggestion_bot

A simple anonymous suggestion bot for Telegram channels.

This is a minimalist anonymous bot written in Python. It has no extra features — just the basics:  
sending text messages and pictures anonymously to a Telegram channel.  
It does **not** use a database, admin IDs, or store any user data.

This bot is useful for Telegram channel admins who want a plug-and-play solution without setting up complex infrastructure.  
It was originally created for a specific use case, so it includes some hardcoded Russian phrases — feel free to replace them with your own.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Telegram Bot API token
